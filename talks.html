    <p>
      Computing at the edge (near the sensor) is preferred over the cloud due to privacy and/or latency concerns for a wide range of applications including robotics/drones, self-driving cars, smart Internet of Things, and portable/wearable electronics. However, at the edge, there are often stringent constraints on energy consumption and cost in addition to the throughput and the accuracy requirements of the application. In this talk, we will describe how the joint design of algorithms and hardware can be used to reduce energy consumption while delivering real-time and robust performance for applications including deep learning, computer vision, autonomous navigation/exploration and video/image processing.

      Pandemics spread before innocent people infect other innocent people. This required a bottom up solution that can capture, analyze and act on the graph of social activities. Can today’s youth use open source open standard solutions to address these challenges? PathCheck Foundation has brought together talented young innovators from all around the world. This is a story about those changemakers.

    3:30-4:00pm: Perpetuating Health Disparities Through AI - LEO CELI (MIT)

  <div class="content">
    <p>
      From machine learning and computer vision to robotics and natural language processing, the application of data science and artificial intelligence is expected to transform healthcare. At present, a key evaluation metric for machine learning in healthcare applications is accuracy. But just because an algorithm is deemed accurate does not mean it will support fairness in healthcare applications. In an ideal world, only individual patient health and disease factors would determine — and guide prediction of — clinical outcomes. However, studies have repeatedly demonstrated that this is far from the case. Data routinely collected in the process of care are heavily influenced by long-standing social, cultural, and institutional biases. Unless the underlying inequities in our communities are addressed, algorithms will perpetuate, if not magnify, existing health disparities.

      As we are leveraging data for making significant decisions that affect individual lives in domains such as health care, justice, finance, education, marketing, and employment, it is important to ensure the safe, ethical, and responsible use of AI. Data scientists know that no longer accuracy is the only concern when developing machine learning models, interpretability and fairness must be considered as well. In order to make sure that machine learning solutions are fair and the value of their predictions easy to understand and explain, it is essential to build tools that developers and data scientists can use to assess their AI system’s fairness and mitigate any observed unfairness issues. This session will focus on Responsible Machine Learning, by explaining the following aspects and tools: - Fairlearn: an open-source Python package to assess AI system’s fairness and mitigate any observed unfairness issues in your machine learning models. - InterpretML: an open-source Python package that helps you understand your model's global behavior, or understand the reasons behind individual predictions.

  <div class="content">
    <p>
      I started LocoRobo in 2015 with a simple mission -- bring educational robots to every classroom in the US by 2020. It is 2020 and we are nowhere close to achieving that naive mission. But we have survived and by all metrics, we have thrived. In this talk, I will share some secrets that have guided us through the ups and downs of the US ed-tech market for over 5 years now. I will also share the best and the worst entrepreneurial decisions that we made during this rewarding journey.

  </button>
  <div class="content">
    <p>
      Before graduating from X as Waymo, Google’s self-driving car project had been using custom
sensors such as lidars, radars, and cameras for several years. In their 5th generation, the
sensors are designed to meet the challenging requirements of moving people and goods safely
and efficiently in dense cities and on highways. Our goal is to make them affordable while
meeting the performance needed for driverless operation in various applications and weather
conditions. This talk will review some history of the project and describe a few use-cases for
sensors and machine learning on Waymo vehicles.

      Ideas come from everywhere, the trick is getting them into the world.  One idea leads to another. This session will follow the origin story of Microsoft’s Project 15 Open Platform for Conservation and Ecological Sustainability.  Internet of Things (IoT) drives sustainability as sensors are at the center of gathering data to generate advanced insights.  The opportunity that IoT and Machine Learning (ML) bring us to re-invent existing processes and innovate on new ideas is immense.  Join us to learn more about Project 15 and leveraging IoT and ML for good.
